"I am not **Link**, but I do know him! Even after 18 years, **the
Legend of Zelda** never stops changing and this game is no
different. We are now taking you to a world where **Link** has
grown up--a world where he will act different and look different."

## Presentation

This project is part of my personal portfolio, part a work, part a hobby to me. This project was made as part of my [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) formation. May this page be a good companion and help you in your adventures with **Link** in **Breath Of The Wild**.

## Vade Mecum

The **Vade Mecum** content belongs to [Hyrule Compendium API](https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/) and it's to their creators the merit belongs. I only used it to render the content in a more comfortable way.
