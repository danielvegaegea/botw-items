"I am not **Link**, but I do know him! Even after 18 years, **the
Legend of Zelda** never stops changing and this game is no
different. We are now taking you to a world where **Link** has
grown up--a world where he will act different and look different."

## Presentation

This project is part of my personal portfolio, part a work, part a hobby to me. This project was made as part of my [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) formation. May this page be a good companion and help you in your adventures with **Link** in **Breath Of The Wild**.

## Vade Mecum

The **Vade Mecum** content belongs to [Hyrule Compendium API](https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/) and it's to their creators the merit belongs. I only used it to render the content in a more comfortable way.

## About the project

The project was created in [React](https://es.reactjs.org/) with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/es/), using [React Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/), [React Markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown), [React Helmet Asyng](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet-async) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). As working framework, I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
